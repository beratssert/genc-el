# Genc-El (Youth-Hand)

**Genc-El** is a social responsibility project designed to bridge the gap between university students and elderly or disabled individuals who need assistance with daily shopping.

    - Easy-to-use interface to create shopping lists.
    - "Call Student" button to request help.
    - Secure verification of accumulated funds and deliveries.
